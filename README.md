# rotten-tomatoes-app
A swift app that uses the Rotten Tomatoes API to display a list of the current most popular movies.  A movie title can be clicked on to view a synopsis and high resolution movie poster.

Required Features:
- User can view a list of movies. Thumbnail poster images load asynchronously using AFNetworking cocoapod.
- User can view movie details by tapping on a cell.
- SVProgressHUD cocoapod is used to display loading state while app waits for the API.
- Error message is displayed when there is a network error (demonstrated in the below gif by turning wifi off)
- User can pull to refresh the movie list

I spent around 15 hours on this assignment and am disappointed that I didn't do any of the optional features.  I am struggling with
the concepts around layout/UI and with the XCode environment, and I plan to do more foundational background reading before next week's assignment.
